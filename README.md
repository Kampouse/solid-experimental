if Your read this its because i added this repo to my github
i wanted to see some new stuff/pattern about data ... and also how to structure css with tailwind so when
you look at the code it does not give you a headhash... 
goal of this would be to  having  2 components that  has a 2way binding  and not doing magic trick
or deep nested pass by props  stuff and also to learn abit of Solidjs :)
